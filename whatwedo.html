      <h3 id="heritage">Heritage Preservation Project</h3>
      <div class="text-part col-md-10" align="justify">
        <p> Sarvalaya has adopted novel approach for the maintenance of idols at ancient Indian heritage places beginning with a strength of 5 volunteers now enrolled to 25 members.
          The traditional method of cleaning the heritage places called “KovilAlwarKaingaryam” or “Uzhavarapani” was initiated by Saint Sri ApparAdigal, Saint Sri Ramanujar and other Saints who are leading exponents of our dharmic culture.<br><br> Uzhavaram is the symbol of service. The word uzhavAram in Tamil refers to the tool that is used to remove any obstructing weeds in the pathways. This is the holy symbol of the great saint thirunAvukkarasar, who himself is a symbol of service.
          
          The ancient heritage places in Tamilnadu stand as historical monuments having sky high towers, beautiful domes, large corridors, huge walls and beautiful Garbhagrahams. It is our duty to preserve and protect them.
          
          The weed growing on these heritage structures are damaging them heavily. Especially the inner stone walls get damaged by pests and insects. As innerwalls of garbhagraham in the heritage places are not exposed to sunlight and due to bad weather conditions, many of them are prone to lose the vibrancy of their sculptural workmanship.
          
          Hence, the Sarvalaya volunteers renders service for the proper upkeep of such heritage places through eradication of weeds, dust, pests and insects and applying sandal paste herbal mix for protection. <br><br>Sarvalaya have prepared a list of heritage places which are in poor condition and through a lot system and will select heritage places periodically for taking up the cleaning activity as explained above. Sarvalaya volunteers camp at the places and take up activities pertaining to cleansing of the ‘inner walls’, removing thick vegetation and thorny bushes. Thereafter the important aspect of cleaning and applying the sandal and herbal mix painting in the innerwalls is done immediately. This results in purification of the heritage structures paving way for generation of positive effects.
          
          Also, Sarvalaya have prepared a list of ancient and dilapidated Indian heritage places where the construction and structure are in poor condition which really require reconstruction or renovation. And selections through an appeal, physical inspection and through public news media.
          
          Sarvalaya team deputes one engineer to estimate the cost of work and professional advice for sustaining structure of Indian heritage places. <br><br> Sarvalya has been undertaking these heritage preservation projects since its inception as one of the key agenda for promotion of art and culture of our nation. So far we have cleaned more than 30 heritage places in Tamilnadu. The team of volunteers involving around 20 persons visit the heritage structures periodically as part of the project activity.<br>
          <br>
          Sarvalya is dedicated to this holy service and constantly devote their attention and effort in keeping the holy abodes of the ancient Indian heritage places clean and vibrant thereby benefitting the entire humanity through the showering grace of such holy abodes.Specifically Sarvalaya is intended to support the organisations who are all providing this service to the ancient Indian heritage places by way of providing food, equipments and other ameneties.
          
          Sarvalaya salute the forbearing feet of the Perfect and Auspicious Being, to indulge us in Its holy service and make this whole world get Its Bliss reverberating. </p>

      <h3 id="art">Promote Indian Art, Culture and Literature</h3>
      <div class="text-part col-md-10" align="justify">
        <p> Culture is the way of life that is vital for the survival of a people living in a society. Cultural heritage is an expression of the ways of living developed and passed on from generation to generation. The terms culture and civilization are used interchangeably. The Indian word for culture is derived from Sanskrit. It means to purify, to transform, to sublimate, to mould and to perfect.
          
          The secular character of Indian culture is a result of the intermingling of people from diverse cultural groups. The values of VasudhaivaKudumbakam and LokaSamasthaSukhinoBhavanthu are the key aspects of Indian tradition. India has a continuous cultural history covering a very long period. The culture associated with the Harappan civilization is the first known urban culture in India.
          
          A large number of Indian heritage places, particularly in rural and semi-urban areas, remain neglected and it is the responsibility of every pious-minded person to ensure their proper upkeep and maintenance. Shortage of manpower is often being cited as the main reason for this neglected condition but the human resources of devotees, if channelized, would resolve the issue.
          
          Remember the services rendered by Sri Ramanujar in evolving various teams of personnel and implementing various administrative, executive, supervisory responsibilities for upkeeping the theIndian heritage places by conducting heritage festivals. <br><br>“Sri Ramanujar assigned specific responsibility to every team and ensure that one does not overlap with another. What is more interesting is that Sri Ramanujar gave equal importance to every section of the society. It is this ‘kainkaryam’ or service to society which is most needed in many heritage Indian heritage places in the villages,” he said, urging the individuals to camp at villages for the proper maintenance of various shrines.
          
          The Srirangam temple was noted for various ancient festivals celebrated for a period spread over eight months every year. “These festivals are being organised by the respective teams or groups evolved by Sri Ramanujar,” he said. </p>

			  To inculcate the Sanathana Dharma and to help the poor and needy of the society, as service to human beings is service to God

Sarvalya is a service oriented voluntary organisation started with the objective of helping the destitute peoples, children, and women in rural areas.

			  <br>

“Service to mankind is service to god”. At times, we all resolve to put in practice, but the modern day busy schedules silently erase our human face. But, there is a way for you to resolve by working with SSTrust which is in the forefront of serving the poor people with special emphasis to aged and rural women folk.
<br><br>
Every person has a right to live life better. But when it comes to rural areas, it may be tough path for rural communities in terms of financial, social and educational aspects. Sarvalya addresses this gap by undertaking appropriate support programs, initiatives and social projects. The trust enables many of us to reach out to rural people and make a difference in their lives.
<br>
Sarvalaya is a service oriented voluntary organization, which has been creating a difference in the lives of downtrodden and less fortunate people over last decade. The organization’s main objective is to reach out to the needy and destitute people in rural areas and support them in many areas.
<br><br>
However, with the active support from kindhearted individuals and organisations, the Trust has evolved itself into a movement of rural youth and taken up the responsibility of rural areas in larger perspective for the benefit of socially and economically poor peoples without discrimination.
<br><br>
The Trust now has the following broad areas of activity including: <br>

I. Annadhanam or Mass feeding<br><br>

Among all the forms of charity, Annadhanam is considered as an act of highest virtue. All the other human needs like clothes, shelter, and education impact only the quality of life but the food impacts the life itself. Hunger is an impatient visitor who arrives unsolicited, at regular intervals of time and demands immediate satisfaction. Hunger and life cannot co-exist. Hunger gnaws at the vitals, immobilizes and finally terminates the life. Annadhanam is a way of viewing the life as precious and aiding its survival. Sharing food is sharing life. That is the reason Annadhanam is even called jeevandhan.<br><br>

Feeding the hungry and deprived, offering food to the yatris (pilgrims), to the birds and animals come under the ambit of Annadhanam. It is a gesture of compassion towards fellow living beings.<br><br>

Fill the stomach, the face lights up and mind is at peace. The negative traits get tempered, if not eliminated. The food is verily a source of joy. Share it with others, the joy multiplies. Hoard it, the food itself perishes.<br><br>

Sarvalaya has proposed to support Annadhanam activity as much as possible to the benefit of entire society. During this year Sarvalaya supported the following:<br><br>

Financial Aid to organizations and persons those who organizing poor feeding on festival days<br><br>

II. Provide aid for medical ailments<br><br>

III. Provide aid for marriage<br><br>
